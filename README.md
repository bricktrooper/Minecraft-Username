# Minecraft-Username
A simple python script that changes your Minecraft username when starting the launcher.

To change your Minecraft username, run the following command:
```
python3 mcname.py
```

#### IMPORTANT:

Make sure to disable your internet connection before starting the Minecraft launcher.  Otherwise, the launcher will overwrite your new username with your official online username.  You can re-enable your internet connection once you reach the Minecraft title screen.  Note that you will only be able to connect to LAN games or internet servers in offline mode.  Minecraft must be started in online mode if you wish to connect to an online server, meaning that you cannot use a custom username on these servers.
